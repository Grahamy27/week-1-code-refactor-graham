# Week-1-Code-Refactor-Graham

HTML,CSS,Git code refactor challenge is a task set for me to improve clients (Horiseon Social Solution Service, Inc)fucntionality of their webpage.

I built this website as I'm a firm believer in easy user accessibility to all websites.
The issues I resolved were that the SEO tab now works correctly and takes you to the correct tab as it previously did not work.
I also tidied all the HTML to resemble semantic HTML and also grouped together the relevant CSS. to make it cleaner looking & make it better for Search Engine Optimisation.
I have also ensured that the code follows the correct semantic HTML elements & that the CSS follows in sequential order.
